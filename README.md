# X201T Screen Rotation

Rotate the screen of your Thinkpad X201T. No need to think about
libwacom or xrandr. The commands `x201tScreenRotate.sh normal`
and `x201tScreenRotate.sh invert` make the program behave like the
[Klein four group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_four-group).

## Usage

    # Rotate the screen 90Â°
    x201tScreenRotate.sh normal
    # Rotate the screen back to normal
    x201tScreenRotate.sh normal
    # Flip the screen along the horizontal axis
    x201tScreenRotate.sh invert
